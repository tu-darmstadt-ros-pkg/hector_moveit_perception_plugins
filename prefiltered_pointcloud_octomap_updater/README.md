# Prefiltered Point Cloud Octomap Updater

This plugin is based on the [pointcloud_octomap_updater](https://github.com/ros-planning/moveit/tree/master/moveit_ros/perception/pointcloud_octomap_updater), but without the self-filtering.
Therefore, it is intended to be used with a pre-filtered point cloud.
